# <span style="color:#e67e22">Welcome to the World of APIs! 👋</span>

Ever wondered how apps talk to each other? That's where **APIs** come in!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">What are APIs? 🤝</span>
*Imagine* an API (Application Programming Interface) like a **friendly waiter** in a restaurant. You tell them what you want (a "request"), and they go to the kitchen (another program/server) to get it for you, then bring back your order (a "response"). It's a set of rules enabling different software to communicate!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">RESTful APIs & HTTP Methods 🌐</span>
**RESTful APIs** are very popular APIs that use standard web communication (HTTP). Think of **HTTP methods** as actions you can take:
*   `GET`: *Fetch* data (like asking for a menu).
*   `POST`: *Create* new data (like ordering food).
*   `PUT`: *Update* existing data (like changing your order).
*   `DELETE`: *Remove* data (like canceling an order).

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Status Codes & JSON 🚦</span>
After your request, you get a **status code** (the waiter's reply):
*   `200 OK`: Success! 🎉 Your request worked.
*   `404 Not Found`: Oops, what you asked for isn't there.
*   `500 Internal Server Error`: Something went wrong on the server's side.
Data is often sent back in **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) – a *super-easy-to-read* format, like a structured shopping list for computers.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Let's See an Example! 🧑‍💻</span>
Here’s how you'd `GET` data using Python:
```python
import requests # A popular library for making web requests

# This sends a GET request to a public API to fetch a 'todo' item
response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1') 

print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}") # Checks if the request was successful
print(f"Data Received: {response.json()}")    # Prints the data in JSON format
# Output: Status Code: 200, Data Received: {'userId': 1, 'id': 1, 'title': 'delectus aut autem', 'completed': False}
```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">What are GET Requests? 🌐</span>

Imagine asking a website for information – that's often a **GET request**! It's how your browser fetches a webpage or an app retrieves data *without changing anything* on the server. Think of it as "read-only" – you're simply *getting* data.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">The Request Part: Asking for Info 📤</span>

When you send a GET request, you might include:

*   ### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Parameters</span>
    These are details you add to the URL after a `?` to specify *what* you want. For example, in `api.example.com/items?_limit=10&page=1`, `_limit=10` and `page=1` are parameters (key-value pairs).

*   ### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Headers</span>
    Like an envelope for your letter, **headers** provide extra info about your request for the server. This could be what kind of data you prefer (`Accept: application/json`) or authentication tokens. They aren't visible in the URL.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client (Your App)] -->|GET Request (URL, Params, Headers)| B[Server]
    B -->|Response (Data, Status Code)| A
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">The Response Part: Getting Data Back 🎉</span>

When the server replies, you get a **response object** containing everything sent back:

*   `response.text`: This gives you the *raw content* as a string, often HTML or plain JSON.
*   `response.json()`: If the response is JSON, this *magically converts* it into a Python dictionary or list, making it super easy to use!
*   `response.status_code`: A crucial number telling you the request's outcome. `200` means "OK!" ✅, `404` means "Not Found" 🚫.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Let's See It in Action! 🚀</span>

Using Python's friendly `requests` library with the Star Wars API:

```python
import requests

url = "https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/" # Asking for Luke Skywalker!
params = {"format": "json"} # Optional: ensuring we get JSON
headers = {"Accept": "application/json"} # Requesting JSON data

response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)

print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}") # E.g., 200
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Character Name: {data['name']}") # Accessing the name!
    # print(f"Raw Content Sample: {response.text[:50]}...")
```
Here, we made a GET request, sent parameters and headers, and then easily accessed the structured data!

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Sending Data with POST Requests! 🚀</span>

Ever need to *send* information to a website or API, like submitting a form or creating a new user? That's where **POST** requests shine! Unlike `GET` (which fetches data), `POST` is designed to securely transmit data to the server for processing. Think of it as mailing a package – you're sending something new!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Packing Your Data 📦</span>

When sending data with POST, you typically use one of two main ways to "pack" it:

*   **`data` parameter:** Great for traditional *HTML form submissions* (e.g., `username=alice&password=123`). This sends data as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.
*   **`json` parameter:** Perfect for sending structured data, especially common with *APIs*. Your data is sent as `application/json` (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`). Libraries like Python's `requests` automatically convert your dictionary to JSON!

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Adding Important Details: Headers & Auth 🔑</span>

*   **Headers:** These are like labels on your package, telling the server more about what you're sending.
    *   `Content-Type`: Crucial! It tells the server if you're sending `application/json` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
    *   `Authorization`: Often used for **authentication**. You might include a *token* (e.g., `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`) here to prove you have permission to send data.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] -->|POST Request (Data + Headers)| B{Server};
    B -->|Check Headers (Content-Type, Auth)| C{Process Data?};
    C -- Yes --> D[Save/Update Data];
    C -- No --> E[Return Error];
    D -->|Success Response (200 OK, 201 Created)| A;
    E -->|Error Response (400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized)| A;
```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Handling `requests` Errors Like a Pro! 🚧</span>

Making web requests is super useful, but sometimes things don't go as planned! Learning to gracefully handle errors makes your code robust and user-friendly. Let's see how `requests` helps us!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Checking Status Codes & `raise_for_status()` ✨</span>

When you make a request, the server sends back a *status code*. `200 OK` means everything's perfect, while `4xx` (like `404 Not Found`) or `5xx` (server errors) mean trouble.
The easiest way to catch these bad codes is `response.raise_for_status()`. It automatically raises an `HTTPError` if the status isn't 200-299!

```python
import requests

try:
    response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/404') # This URL will return a 404
    response.raise_for_status() # This line will raise an HTTPError!
    print("Success!") # This won't print if there's an error
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    print(f"Oops! HTTP Error occurred: {e}") # Catches errors like 404, 500
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Make Request (e.g., requests.get())] --> B{response.raise_for_status()};
    B -- Status Code is 2xx --> C[Continue processing response];
    B -- Status Code is NOT 2xx --> D[Raise requests.exceptions.HTTPError];
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Timeouts ⏳</span>
Sometimes, a server just takes too long. You can set a `timeout` limit. If the server doesn't respond in time, a `Timeout` exception is raised.

```python
try:
    requests.get('https://httpbin.org/delay/5', timeout=2) # This will wait 5s, but we only allow 2s
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print("Request timed out after 2 seconds!") # Catches when the server takes too long
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Connection & Other Errors 🚫</span>
What if there's no internet connection, or the domain doesn't even exist? These are often `ConnectionError` or other `RequestException` types. A broad `try-except` block is your best friend here!

```python
try:
    requests.get('http://nonexistent-domain-12345.com') # This URL won't resolve
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
    print("Could not connect to the server! Check your internet or URL.")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}") # Catches any other requests-related issue
```
