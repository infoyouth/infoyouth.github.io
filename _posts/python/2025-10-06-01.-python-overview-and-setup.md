# <span style="color:#e67e22">Python's Awesome Features 🐍</span>

Let's explore what makes Python so popular and easy to love!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Why Python Rocks: Key Features</span>

- **Simplicity and Readability ✨:** Python's syntax is _super_ clean and easy to understand, like reading plain English.

  ```python
  # Example: Simple if statement
  if age >= 18:
      print("You can vote!")
  ```

  Unlike other languages with lots of confusing symbols, Python keeps it simple.

- **Interpreted Nature ⚙️:** Python code is executed line by line. This makes debugging easier because you can find errors quickly. It doesn't need to be compiled into machine code before running, saving you time!

  ```mermaid
  graph LR
  A([📄 Source Code]):::source --> B((🔧 Interpreter)):::interpreter;
  B --> C{⚡ Execute Line}:::execute;
  C -->|Yes| D([✅ Output/Error]):::output;
  C -->|No| C;

  classDef source fill:#3498db,stroke:#2980b9,stroke-width:3px,stroke-dasharray:5;
  classDef interpreter fill:#e74c3c,stroke:#c0392b,stroke-width:3px;
  classDef execute fill:#f39c12,stroke:#e67e22,stroke-width:2px;
  classDef output fill:#27ae60,stroke:#16a085,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray:3;
  ```

- **Dynamic Typing ✏️:** You don't have to declare variable types in Python. The interpreter figures it out for you!

  ```python
  # Example: Dynamic Typing
  x = 10       # x is an integer
  x = "Hello"  # x is now a string
  ```

- **Extensive Standard Library 📚:** Python comes with a _huge_ collection of modules and functions ready to use. Need to work with files, web requests, or math? Python has you covered.

  ```python
  # Example: Using the math module
  import math
  print(math.sqrt(25)) # Output: 5.0
  ```

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility 💻:** Python runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more! Write code once, run it almost anywhere.

  ```mermaid

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Python's Amazing Journey 🐍</span>

Python, a super popular coding language, started in **1991** with Guido van Rossum. He wanted a language that was easy to read and powerful.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Major Milestones 🚀</span>

Python quickly grew, becoming a favorite for beginners and experts alike. A big turning point was the move from _Python 2_ to _Python 3_. Python 3 made some big changes to clean up the language, but it meant old Python 2 code sometimes needed tweaking.

- **Python 3.6**: Introduced f-strings for easier string formatting.
- **Python 3.10**: Added pattern matching, a way to make code cleaner when checking different conditions.
- **Python 3.12**: Showed off better error messages and `performance` improvements.
- **Python 3.13**: More speed enhancements and developer experience upgrades are expected.

Python keeps evolving, staying modern and useful! The development continues with new features to make it an even more powerful tool. 🧑‍💻

Alright, let's dive into the exciting new features of Python 3.13! 🚀

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Python 3.13: What's New?</span>

Python 3.13 (released October 2024) brings some _game-changing_ improvements! Here's what makes it special:

## <span style="color:#2980b9">🚀 Experimental JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time)</span>

Python 3.13 introduces an **experimental JIT compiler** that can make your code run _significantly faster_! In some cases, you can see up to **2x performance improvements**. While it's still experimental, this is a huge step forward for Python's speed.

```python
# Enable JIT when running Python
# python --enable-experimental-jit your_script.py
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">🔓 Free-Threaded Mode (No GIL!)</span>

This is **MASSIVE**! Python 3.13 can now run without the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) using the `--disable-gil` flag. This means true parallel processing for CPU-intensive tasks! Before this, Python could only run one thread at a time, even on multi-core processors.

```python
# Run Python without GIL for better multi-threading
# python --disable-gil your_parallel_script.py
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">📱 Mobile Platform Support</span>

Python now officially supports **iOS and Android** as tier-3 platforms! You can build Python apps for mobile devices natively. This opens up exciting new possibilities for mobile development with Python.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">🎨 Better Error Messages & REPL</span>

Error messages are now even more informative. They provide clearer guidance, helping you debug your code faster. The interactive shell (REPL) also got major upgrades:

- **Smarter suggestions:** Python guesses what you meant when you make typos
- **Multi-line editing:** Edit code across multiple lines easily
- **Syntax highlighting:** Colors in your terminal make code easier to read

```python
# Example of improved error messages:
>>> print(name)
NameError: name 'name' is not defined. Did you mean: 'main'?
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">🗑️ Deprecations & Removals</span>

Python 3.13 cleaned house! Some old, rarely-used features from the Python 2 era have been removed:

- Removed 20-year-old deprecated functions
- `wave.Wave_read.getmarkers()` and related methods removed
- `locale.getdefaultlocale()` deprecated (use `locale.setlocale()` instead)

This keeps Python modern and easier to maintain!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Resources</span>

**In Short:** Find the right environment that **fits** your _style_ and _project_. Good luck coding! 💻

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Hello, World! in Python 🐍</span>

Let's get started with Python! This guide will walk you through creating and running your first "Hello, World!" program.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">The Basic "Hello, World!"</span>

Writing this program is super simple:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This single line is all you need! The `print()` function displays text on your screen.

```
Output: Hello, World!
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Running Your Code</span>

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">From the Command Line</span>

1. Save the code above in a file named `hello.py`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.py`.
4. Type `python hello.py` and press Enter. You should see "Hello, World!" printed.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Using an IDE</span>

Most _IDEs_ (Integrated Development Environments) like VS Code or PyCharm have a run button. Just open your `hello.py` file in the IDE and click the run button. The output will usually appear in a console window within the IDE.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">A Little More Fun: User Input</span>

Let's make it interactive:

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

This code first _asks_ the user for their name using the `input()` function and then _greets_ them personally.

```
Output:
What's your name? Alice
Hello, Alice!
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Code Structure</span>

- **`print()`:** A built-in Python function that displays text.
- **`input()`:** A built-in function that prompts the user for input.
- **Strings:** Text enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).
- **Variables:** Used to store values (e.g., `name`).
