# <span style="color:#e67e22">Regular Expressions: Your Text-Processing Friend ü§ù</span>

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are powerful patterns used to search and manipulate text.  Think of them as wildcards on steroids! They let you find specific text within larger blocks, regardless of its exact position.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Why are they important?</span>

Regexes are crucial for text processing because they automate tasks that would be tedious manually.  Imagine finding *all* email addresses in a large document ‚Äì regexes make this quick and easy. They're used in countless applications, from code editors to web search engines.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Shell Scripting & Regex</span>

In shell scripting (like bash), tools like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` use regexes extensively.  For example, `grep "pattern" file.txt` searches `file.txt` for lines containing "pattern".

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Basic Regex Examples</span>

*   `.` matches any single character.
*   `*` matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.
*   `+` matches one or more occurrences.
*   `?` matches zero or one occurrence.
*   `[abc]` matches any of `a`, `b`, or `c`.
*   `\d` matches any digit.
*   `\w` matches any alphanumeric character.


**Example:**  `grep "\w+@\w+\.\w+" email_list.txt` finds email addresses in `email_list.txt`.

This shows a simplified view. Regexes can be incredibly complex, but understanding the basics is a great starting point!


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Grep & Regular Expressions: A Friendly Guide</span> üîé

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Basic Grep with Regular Expressions</span>

`grep` is a powerful command-line tool that searches for patterns within files.  Combined with regular expressions (regex), it becomes incredibly versatile.  A basic example: finding lines containing "error" in a log file:

```bash
grep "error" mylogfile.txt
```

This uses a simple string match.  For more complex patterns, use regex. For instance, to find lines containing any number followed by "errors":

```bash
grep "[0-9]+ errors" mylogfile.txt
```

`[0-9]+` matches one or more digits.


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Basic Regex Characters</span>

*   `.` matches any single character.
*   `*` matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.
*   `+` matches one or more occurrences.
*   `[]` defines a character set (e.g., `[abc]` matches 'a', 'b', or 'c').


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Extended Grep (egrep)</span>

`egrep` (or `grep -E`) uses extended regular expressions, offering more concise syntax.  For example, the `+` and `?` quantifiers are built-in without needing backslashes:


```bash
egrep "error+" mylogfile.txt #Matches "error", "errorr", etc.
```

**Note:**  Always escape special characters like `.` , `*`, `+`, `?` with a backslash `\`  when using them literally (not as regex metacharacters) within basic `grep`.

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Using `sed` for Text Manipulation</span> ‚úçÔ∏è

`sed` (stream editor) is a powerful command-line tool for searching and replacing text within files or input streams.  It's incredibly useful in shell scripts for automating text processing tasks.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Basic Search and Replace</span> üîÑ

The basic syntax is:  `sed 's/pattern/replacement/g' file.txt`

*   `s`:  Specifies substitution.
*   `/pattern/`: The text to search for.
*   `/replacement/`: The text to replace it with.
*   `g`:  Replaces *all* occurrences (omit for only the first).

**Example:** Replacing "apple" with "orange" in `my_file.txt`:

```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/g' my_file.txt
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Deletion and Insertion</span> ‚úÇÔ∏è‚ûï

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Deletion</span>
To delete lines matching a pattern:

```bash
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt
```

**Example:** Deleting lines containing "error":

```bash
sed '/error/d' my_log.txt
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Insertion</span>
To insert text *before* a line matching a pattern:

```bash
sed '/pattern/i\text to insert' file.txt
```

**Example:** Inserting "Important Note:" before lines containing "warning":

```bash
sed '/warning/i\Important Note:' my_log.txt
```


For more detailed information and advanced `sed` commands, refer to the [GNU sed manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html).  Happy scripting! üéâ


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Awk: Your Friend for Text Wrangling ü§ù</span>

Awk is a powerful command-line tool for processing text and data.  Think of it as a mini-programming language specifically designed for pattern matching and text manipulation. It's incredibly useful for working with structured data like CSV files.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Awk and CSV Files üóÑÔ∏è</span>

Awk excels at handling CSV (Comma Separated Value) data. Each line in a CSV file represents a record, and each field within a record is separated by a comma.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example: Extracting Specific Columns</span>

Let's say you have a CSV file named `data.csv` with columns `Name`, `Age`, and `City`. To extract just the `Name` and `Age` columns, you'd use this command:

```bash
awk -F, '{print $1, $2}' data.csv 
```

Here, `-F,` sets the field separator to a comma, and `{print $1, $2}` prints the first and second fields (Name and Age).


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Beyond Basic Extraction ‚ú®</span>

Awk allows for much more complex operations:

*   **Filtering rows:**  `awk '$3 == "New York" {print}' data.csv` prints only rows where the city is New York.
*   **Calculations:** You can perform calculations on numeric fields.
*   **Conditional logic:** Use `if`, `else` statements to control what Awk does.

Remember, Awk is a versatile tool. Mastering its basics opens up a world of efficient text processing possibilities.


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Regular Expression Metacharacters Explained üîé</span>

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are powerful tools for pattern matching in text. Here are some common metacharacters:


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Basic Metacharacters</span>

* **`.` (Dot):** Matches any single character except a newline.  `r".at"` matches "cat", "hat", "bat", etc.

* **`*` (Star):** Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character. `r"ca*t"` matches "ct", "cat", "caaat", etc.

* **`?` (Question Mark):** Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character. `r"colou?r"` matches both "color" and "colour".

* **`+` (Plus):** Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character. `r"ca+t"` matches "cat", "caat", "caaat", but not "ct".


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Anchors and Character Sets</span>

* **`^` (Caret):** Matches the beginning of a string. `r"^Hello"` matches "Hello world" but not "World Hello".

* **`$` (Dollar):** Matches the end of a string. `r"world$"` matches "Hello world" but not "world Hello".

* **`[]` (Square Brackets):** Defines a character set. `r"[aeiou]"` matches any single lowercase vowel.  `r"[a-z]"` matches any lowercase letter.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Grouping and Quantifiers</span>

* **`()` (Parentheses):** Groups characters together.  `r"(abc)+"` matches "abc", "abcabc", etc.

* **`{}` (Curly Braces):** Specifies the number of occurrences. `r"a{2,4}"` matches "aa", "aaa", "aaaa".


**Example:**  The regex `r"^[A-Z][a-z]+ \d{5}$"` would match strings like "John 12345" (capital letter, lowercase letters, space, 5 digits).

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Advanced Regex in Shell Scripting</span>  ‚ú®

Regex, or regular expressions, are powerful tools for text manipulation. Let's explore some advanced techniques:


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Grouping and Backreferences</span> 

Grouping uses parentheses `()` to capture parts of a match.  Backreferences, using `\1`, `\2`, etc.,  refer to previously captured groups.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example</span>

Finding and replacing repeated words:

```bash
string="hello hello world"
echo "$string" | sed 's/\(\w\+\) \1/\1/'  # Output: hello world
```

Here, `\(\w\+\)` captures a word, and `\1` refers to it, replacing repeated words.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Lookarounds</span> 

Lookarounds assert conditions without including them in the match.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Positive Lookahead</span>

`(?=pattern)`: Matches only if followed by `pattern`.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example</span>

Finding words ending in "ing":

```bash
string="singing running jumping"
echo "$string" | grep -o '\w\+(?=ing)' # Output: sing run jump
```

`(?=ing)` ensures only words ending in "ing" are matched, but "ing" itself isn't included in the output.
