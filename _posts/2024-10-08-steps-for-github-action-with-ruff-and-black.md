# üîç What Reusable GitHub Actions Are and Why They Are Useful

## **Introduction**

**Reusable GitHub Actions** are like **templates** for workflows. They allow you
to **define a set of tasks** that can be reused across multiple projects. This
means you don‚Äôt have to write the same code over and over again for different
repositories.

### **Why Use Reusable Actions?**

1. **Embrace the DRY Principle**:

   - <span style="color:#00BFFF; font-weight:bold;">**DRY**</span> stands for
     _Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself_. By using
     <span style="color:#32CD32; font-weight:bold;">**reusable actions**</span>,
     you can avoid redundancy in your code. Instead of writing the same
     workflows in every project, you can simply call the action whenever you
     need it.

   ![DRY Principle](https://via.placeholder.com/300x100/007BFF/FFFFFF?text=DRY+Principle)

2. **Consistency Across Projects**:

   - Using the same action across different repositories ensures that your
     workflows remain
     <span style="color:#FFD700; font-weight:bold;">**consistent**</span>. This
     leads to fewer errors and makes it easier for new developers to understand
     how things work.

3. **Simplified Maintenance**:

   - When you need to update a process, you only have to change it in one
     place‚Äîthe <span style="color:#32CD32; font-weight:bold;">**reusable
     action**</span>. This makes maintaining your code much easier and less
     time-consuming.

4. **Faster Development**:
   - <span style="color:#FF4500; font-weight:bold;">**Reusable actions**</span>
     save time. By leveraging pre-defined workflows, developers can focus on
     building new features instead of repetitive tasks.

### **Example**

Imagine you‚Äôre working on multiple projects that require
<span style="color:#FFD700; font-weight:bold;">**code quality checks**</span>.
Instead of creating the same checks in each repository, you can create one
<span style="color:#32CD32; font-weight:bold;">**reusable action**</span> for
those checks and use it in all your projects.

Here‚Äôs a simple flow of how this works:

1. **Create the Action**: Define the tasks (like running tests or checking code
   style).
2. **Publish the Action**: Make it available for your other repositories.
3. **Use the Action**: Reference this action in your projects, and it will run
   the defined tasks.

### **Conclusion**

In summary, <span style="color:#00BFFF; font-weight:bold;">**reusable GitHub
Actions**</span> streamline your development process, promote
<span style="color:#FFD700; font-weight:bold;">**best practices**</span>, and
enhance collaboration within teams. They are a powerful tool for any developer
looking to improve
<span style="color:#FF4500; font-weight:bold;">**efficiency**</span> and
<span style="color:#FFD700; font-weight:bold;">**consistency**</span> in their
projects.

> **Pro Tip**: Always document your
> <span style="color:#32CD32; font-weight:bold;">**reusable actions**</span>
> clearly so that other developers (and future you!) can easily understand how
> to use them.

_Remember: Good tools make good developers!_

# üõ†Ô∏è The Main Steps to Create Your GitHub Action

Creating a **GitHub Action** involves several key steps. These steps guide you
through defining what your action will do, setting it up in a repository, and
ensuring it runs smoothly. Following these steps helps you create a **reusable
action** that can enhance your workflows.

### <span style="color:#00FFFF; font-weight:bold;">Step 1: Define the Purpose and Requirements</span>

- Start by clearly defining the purpose of your action. What tasks do you want
  to automate?
- Consider integrating tools like
  <span style="color:#00BFFF; font-weight:bold;">**Ruff**</span> for linting and
  <span style="color:#32CD32; font-weight:bold;">**Black**</span> for automatic
  code formatting. Identify specific configurations and rules you‚Äôll need for
  both tools.

  > **Example**: If you want to enforce a specific style with
  > <span style="color:#32CD32; font-weight:bold;">**Black**</span>, set the
  > options in your configuration.

### <span style="color:#00FFFF; font-weight:bold;">Step 2: Set Up a New GitHub Repository</span>

- Create a dedicated GitHub repository for your action.
- Organize your folder structure to keep your files neat. This separation makes
  it easier to find files related to your action and documentation.

  ```bash
  mkdir my-github-action
  cd my-github-action
  mkdir .github/workflows
  ```

### <span style="color:#00FFFF; font-weight:bold;">Step 3: Create the Action Metadata File</span>

In this step, you will create an important file called
<span style="color:#FFD700; font-weight:bold;">`action.yml`</span>. This file
tells GitHub about your action and how it works. It defines inputs, outputs, and
the steps your action will execute.

#### **Creating the Directory and File**

1. **Open Your Terminal**:

   - Navigate to your GitHub repository directory using the terminal. You can
     use the command:

     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/repo
     ```

2. **Create the Directory Structure**:

   - Create a new directory for your action inside the `.github` folder. Use the
     following command:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p .github/actions/my-action
     ```

3. **Create the `action.yml` File**:

   - Now, create the `action.yml` file in the new directory:

     ```bash
     touch .github/actions/my-action/action.yml
     ```

#### **Writing the Metadata**

Open the `action.yml` file in a text editor (like VS Code, Atom, etc.) and add
the following content:

```yaml
name: "My GitHub Action" # The name of your action
description: "A reusable action for code quality checks" # Brief description of what your action does
inputs: # Define the inputs your action will accept
  directory:
    description: "The directory of Python files to analyze" # Explain the input
    required: true # This input is mandatory
    default: "./" # Default value if not provided
  ruff_config:
    description: "Configuration options for Ruff" # Explain the input
    required: false # This input is optional
    default: "" # Default value if not provided
  black_config:
    description: "Configuration options for Black" # Explain the input
    required: false # This input is optional
    default: "" # Default value if not provided
runs: # Define how your action runs
  using: "composite" # This means it's a composite action
  steps: # List the steps your action will execute
    - name: Run Ruff # Step name
      run: ruff ${ { inputs.directory } } --config ${ { inputs.ruff_config } } # Command to run Ruff
    - name: Run Black # Step name
      run: black ${ { inputs.directory } } --config ${ { inputs.black_config } } # Command to run Black
```

#### <span style="color:#FFD700; font-weight:bold;"> Components of `action.yml`</span>

- **<span style="color:#FF6347;">`name`</span>**: This is the name of your
  action, which will appear in the GitHub UI.

- **<span style="color:#00BFFF;">`description`</span>**: A short summary of what
  your action does.

- **<span style="color:#32CD32;">`inputs`</span>**: These are the parameters
  your action can accept. You define what inputs are required and what their
  defaults should be.

- **<span style="color:#FF4500;">`runs`</span>**: This section specifies how
  your action will run. Here, we are using a composite action, which allows you
  to run multiple commands in sequence.

- **<span style="color:#9370DB;">`steps`</span>**: Each step is a command that
  will be executed when the action is run. In this example, we are running
  <span style="color:#00BFFF;">**Ruff**</span> and
  <span style="color:#FFD700;">**Black**</span> on the specified directory of
  Python files.

### <span style="color:#00FFFF; font-weight:bold;">Step 4: Write the Code for the Action</span>

In this step, you‚Äôll write the code that your action will execute. The main goal
is to run **<span style="color:#00BFFF;">Ruff</span>** and
**<span style="color:#32CD32;">Black</span>** on the specified Python files to
check for linting issues and format the code automatically.

#### **<span style="color:#FF6347;">Creating a Script for Your Action</span>**

You can create a script using **shell commands** or a **Python script**. Let‚Äôs
go with a simple shell script to invoke both tools:

- **Create a file named** `run.sh` inside the folder where your `action.yml` is
  located: ie in `.github/workflows/run.sh` and copy paste below content in the
  script

```bash
# run.sh
echo "Running Ruff and Black on the specified directory..."
ruff .            # Runs Ruff on the current directory
black .           # Automatically formats Python files using Black
```

<span style="color:#9370DB;">Modify the action.yml File to Include the
Script</span>

```yaml
name: Lint and Format Action
description: This action runs Ruff and Black on the specified Python files.
inputs:
  path:
    description: "The directory to run Ruff and Black on"
    required: true
    default: "."
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: Run Ruff and Black
      run: ./run.sh
```

<span style="color:#FFD700;">Test and Verify Your Action</span>

- Create a new branch and commit your changes.
- Create a pull request or push your branch to trigger the workflow and see if
  <span style="color:#00BFFF;">**Ruff**</span> and
  <span style="color:#FFD700;">**Black**</span> are executed correctly.
