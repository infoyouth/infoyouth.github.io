# <span style="color:#e67e22">Conditional Statements in Python: `if`, `if-else`, `elif`</span> 

Conditional statements control the flow of your code based on whether a condition is true or false.  Let's explore them!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">The `if` Statement 👨‍💻</span>

The simplest form checks a single condition.

```python
import os
if os.path.exists("my_file.txt"):  #checks if file exists
    print("File exists!") 
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example: Numerical Comparison</span>

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">The `if-else` Statement ⚖️</span>

This handles two possibilities: true or false.

```python
age = 15
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("You are too young to vote.")
```


## <span style="color:#2980b9">The `elif` Statement 🔀</span>

Handles multiple conditions sequentially.  It's like saying, "if the first condition is false, *then* check this one, and *then* this one..."


```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("C")
else:
    print("F")
```

**More Info:**  For a deeper dive, check out the official Python documentation on [conditional statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html).


**Note:** Remember indentation is crucial in Python!  Incorrect indentation will lead to errors.  Use 4 spaces for consistent and readable code.


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Shell Scripting Loops 🎉</span>

Shell scripts use loops to repeat commands. Let's explore `for`, `while`, and `until` loops!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Loop Types 🔄</span>

*   **`for` loop:** Iterates over a list of items.  Example: iterating through files in a directory:
    ```bash
    for file in *.txt; do echo "$file"; done
    ```
*   **`while` loop:** Repeats as long as a condition is true. Example: prompting for user input until a specific value is entered:
    ```bash
    while [[ "$input" != "quit" ]]; do read -p "Enter input (or 'quit'): " input; done
    ```
*   **`until` loop:** Repeats until a condition becomes true (opposite of `while`). Example:  repeating a task until a file exists:

    ```bash
    until [ -f "myfile.txt" ]; do echo "Waiting for myfile.txt..."; sleep 1; done
    ```


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Numerical Ranges with `for`</span>
You can also use `for` loops with numerical ranges using brace expansion or `seq`:

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do echo "$i"; done  #Prints 1 to 5
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Applications 🚀</span>

Loops are useful for:

*   **File processing:**  Processing multiple files, like converting images or extracting data.
*   **User interaction:**  Creating interactive scripts that repeatedly ask for input.
*   **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks, such as backups or system checks.


**More Info:**  For a deeper dive, explore the [Bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html).  Remember to always test your scripts carefully! 😉


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Shell Scripting's `case` Statements: A Simpler Way</span> 

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Understanding `case` Statements ✨</span>

The `case` statement in shell scripts is like a super-charged `if-else if-else` structure. It elegantly handles multiple conditions based on a single variable's value.  Think of it as a powerful switch for your script's logic!

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Simple Example: A Menu</span>

```bash
read -p "Enter choice (1-3): " choice
case $choice in
  1) echo "You chose option 1";;
  2) echo "You chose option 2";;
  3) echo "You chose option 3";;
  *) echo "Invalid choice";; 
esac
```

This script presents a menu and uses `case` to execute different commands based on user input.  `*)` acts as a default case for invalid input.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">More Advanced Uses 🚀</span>

* **User Input Handling:**  Validate user input easily.  Check for specific values or patterns.
* **Process Control:**  Decide what actions to take based on the outcome of other commands or events.

**Example: Process Control**

```bash
status=$?  #Check the exit status of a previous command
case $status in
  0) echo "Command succeeded!";;
  1) echo "Command failed!";;
  *) echo "Something unexpected happened!";;
esac
```

**Flowchart:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Read User Input] --> B{Case Statement};
    B -- Choice 1 --> C[Execute Option 1];
    B -- Choice 2 --> D[Execute Option 2];
    B -- Choice 3 --> E[Execute Option 3];
    B -- Default --> F[Invalid Choice];
    C --> G[End];
    D --> G;
    E --> G;
    F --> G;
```

Using `case` makes your shell scripts cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain, especially when dealing with many conditional branches.  It's a fundamental tool for any shell scripting enthusiast! 😊


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Controlling Loops with `break` and `continue` in Shell Scripting 🎉</span>

Shell scripting offers `break` and `continue` statements to manage loop flow.  These are invaluable for handling situations where you need to adjust loop behavior based on certain conditions.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">The `break` Statement 💥</span>

The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop it's inside.  Execution continues with the statement after the loop.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example:</span>

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    break  # Exit loop when i equals 5
  fi
  echo $i
done
```

This loop will print numbers 1 through 4, then stop.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">The `continue` Statement ⏩</span>

`continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example:</span>

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  if [ $((i % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
    continue  # Skip even numbers
  fi
  echo $i
done
```

This loop prints only odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Visualizing the Difference 🤔</span>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Loop] --> B{Condition?};
    B -- True --> C[break];
    B -- False --> D[Process Iteration];
    D --> E[Next Iteration];
    C --> F[End Loop];
    E --> B;
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Loop] --> B{Condition?};
    B -- True --> C[continue];
    B -- False --> D[Process Iteration];
    D --> E[Next Iteration];
    C --> E;
    E --> B;
```

*(Note:  These diagrams illustrate the flow; the exact implementation in shell scripting might vary slightly.)*

**Remember**:  These statements significantly improve the readability and efficiency of your shell scripts by allowing fine-grained control over looping.  Use them wisely to create cleaner and more robust code!


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Logical Operators in Shell Scripts 🤝</span>

Shell scripts often need to check multiple conditions.  This is where logical operators shine!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`)</span>

*   `&&` (AND):  This operator executes the second command *only if* the first command succeeds (exits with a status code of 0). Think of it as "both conditions must be true".

*   `||` (OR): This operator executes the second command *only if* the first command *fails* (exits with a non-zero status code).  Think of it as "at least one condition must be true".


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Examples</span>

Let's say you want to check if a file exists and is writable:

```bash
[ -f myfile.txt ] && [ -w myfile.txt ] && echo "File exists and is writable" || echo "File problem!"
```

This first checks if `myfile.txt` exists (`-f`), then if it's writable (`-w`). *Only if both are true*, it prints the success message. Otherwise, the error message shows up.

Another example:  Back up a file *only if* it's modified since the last backup *or* it's larger than 1GB:

```bash
[ $(stat -c %Y myfile.txt) -gt $(stat -c %Y backup.txt) ] || [ $(stat -c %s myfile.txt) -gt 1073741824 ] && cp myfile.txt backup.txt
```

This checks file modification time and size before creating a backup.

**Remember:**  `0` means success, any other number means failure in shell return codes.
