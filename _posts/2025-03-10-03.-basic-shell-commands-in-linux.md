# <span style="color:#e67e22">Essential Linux Shell Commands</span> ✨

These commands are the building blocks of navigating and managing files in Linux.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Navigation & Listing</span> 🗺️

*   **`pwd` (Print Working Directory):** Shows your current location.  `pwd`
*   **`cd` (Change Directory):** Moves you to a different directory.  `cd /home/user`  changes to the `/home/user` directory.
*   **`ls` (List):** Shows files and directories in the current location. `ls -l` (long listing) shows detailed information.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">File Manipulation</span> 🗂️

*   **`cp` (Copy):** Copies files or directories. `cp file1.txt file2.txt` copies `file1.txt` to `file2.txt`.
*   **`mv` (Move/Rename):** Moves or renames files/directories. `mv file1.txt newfile.txt` renames `file1.txt`.
*   **`rm` (Remove):** Deletes files or directories.  *Use with caution!* `rm file.txt` deletes `file.txt`.  `rm -r directory` recursively deletes a directory (and its contents).
*   **`mkdir` (Make Directory):** Creates a new directory. `mkdir new_directory` creates the `new_directory`.


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example: File Management Workflow</span>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Create Directory] --> B{Copy File};
    B --> C[Rename File];
    C --> D{List Files};
    D --> E[Remove File];
```

For more in-depth information, explore these resources:

* [Linux Documentation Project](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/)
* [The Linux Command Line](https://linuxcommand.org/)


Remember to always be careful when using `rm`, especially with the `-r` flag, as deleted data is typically unrecoverable.  Practice these commands in a safe environment (like a virtual machine) to avoid accidental data loss.


# <span style="color:#e67e22">File & Directory Management in Linux 📁</span>

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Creating and Deleting</span>

*   **Creating Files:** `touch my_file.txt` creates an empty file named `my_file.txt`.  `touch` is like giving a file a name.
*   **Creating Directories:** `mkdir my_directory` creates a new folder named `my_directory`. `mkdir -p dir1/dir2` creates nested directories.
*   **Deleting Files:** `rm my_file.txt` deletes `my_file.txt`.  Use `rm -r my_directory` to remove a directory and its contents (**be careful!**).


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Finding and Viewing</span>

*   **`find`:**  Locates files based on criteria. `find . -name "*.txt"` finds all `.txt` files in the current directory and below.
*   **`locate`:**  A faster, but less accurate, way to find files based on name (uses a database). `locate my_file.txt`.
*   **`tree`:** Displays the directory structure in a tree-like format.  `tree .` shows the current directory's structure.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Other Useful Commands</span>

*   `cp source destination`: Copies files or directories.  `cp my_file.txt backup.txt`
*   `mv source destination`: Moves or renames files/directories. `mv my_file.txt new_file.txt`
*   `rm -rf my_directory`: Recursively deletes a directory and its contents (use with extreme caution!).


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example: File Operations</span>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Create file: touch file.txt] --> B{File exists?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Modify file];
    B -- No --> C;
    C --> D[Delete file: rm file.txt];
```

For more information, check out the [Linux Documentation Project](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/). Remember to always back up your data before performing potentially destructive actions like using `rm -rf`!


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Linux Process Management: Your Handy Toolkit 🛠️</span>

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Monitoring Processes 👀</span>

*   `ps`: Shows running processes.  `ps aux` displays a detailed list.
*   `top`: Displays dynamic, real-time process information, constantly updated.  Use `top` to see CPU and memory usage.
*   `htop`: An interactive, improved version of `top` with a user-friendly interface.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Managing Processes 🕹️</span>

*   `kill`: Terminates processes. `kill <PID>` sends a termination signal; `kill -9 <PID>` forces termination (use cautiously!).
*   `jobs`: Lists background jobs.  Useful for managing processes started with `&`.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Examples ✨</span>

*   List all processes: `ps aux`
*   Kill process with ID 1234: `kill 1234`
*   Forcefully kill process with ID 5678: `kill -9 5678` (Use with care!)
*   List background jobs: `jobs`

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Further Exploration 🚀</span>

For more in-depth information, explore the `man` pages (e.g., `man ps`, `man kill`).  Many online resources also offer comprehensive guides.

**Note:** Always be careful when using `kill -9`, as it can lead to data loss if not used appropriately.  Try a gentler `kill` first.


# <span style="color:#e67e22">File Permissions & Ownership 🧑‍💻</span>

Every file has an *owner*, a *group*, and *permissions* controlling who can access it (read, write, execute).

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Understanding Permissions 🔑</span>

Permissions are represented by three sets of three characters (e.g., `rwxr-xr-x`). Each set applies to the *owner*, *group*, and *others* respectively.  `r`=read, `w`=write, `x`=execute.  `-` means no permission.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example:</span> `rwxr-xr-x`

* **Owner:**  Read, write, and execute.
* **Group:** Read and execute.
* **Others:** Read and execute.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Modifying Permissions with `chmod` ⚙️</span>

`chmod` changes permissions.  You can use *octal* (e.g., `chmod 755 file.txt`) or *symbolic* (e.g., `chmod u+x file.txt` adds execute permission for the *user*) modes.

*   `u` = user, `g` = group, `o` = others, `a` = all
*   `+` = add, `-` = remove, `=` = set

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Modifying Ownership with `chown` & `chgrp` 👤👥</span>

`chown` changes the *owner*, and `chgrp` changes the *group*.  For example:

*   `chown john:users file.txt` changes the owner to "john" and the group to "users".
*   `chgrp developers file.txt` changes the group to "developers".

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Mastering Command-Line Power: Redirection & Pipes ⚡️</span>

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Input/Output Redirection: Changing the Flow 🔄</span>

Imagine your commands as tiny workers.  Redirection lets you control where they get their input from and send their output to.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Redirection Symbols:</span>

* `>`: Sends output to a *new* file.  `ls -l > file_list.txt` creates `file_list.txt` containing the `ls -l` output.
* `>>`: Appends output to an *existing* file. `date >> file_list.txt` adds the current date to the file.
* `<`: Takes input from a file. `wc -w < my_document.txt` counts words in `my_document.txt`.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Pipes: Connecting Commands 🔗</span>

Pipes let you chain commands together, passing a command's output as the input to the next. Think of it as an assembly line!

Example: `ls -l | grep "txt"` first lists files (`ls -l`), then filters for only those containing "txt" (`grep "txt"`).


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Pipe Symbol:</span>

* `|`: The pipe symbol connects commands.


```mermaid
graph LR
A[ls -l] --> B{pipe |};
B --> C[grep "txt"];
```

This shows `ls -l`'s output feeding into `grep "txt"`.
