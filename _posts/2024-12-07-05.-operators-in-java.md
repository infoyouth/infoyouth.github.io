# <span style="color:#e67e22">Java Arithmetic Operators ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó%</span>

This guide explains the **basic operators in Java**, focusing on arithmetic operations.  These are fundamental to any Java program.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Basic Arithmetic Operators</span>

Java provides standard arithmetic operators for performing calculations. Let's explore them with examples:


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Addition (+)</span>

```java
int sum = 10 + 5; // Adds 10 and 5
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Output: Sum: 15
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Subtraction (-)</span>

```java
int difference = 20 - 8; // Subtracts 8 from 20
System.out.println("Difference: " + difference); // Output: Difference: 12
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Multiplication (*)</span>

```java
int product = 7 * 4; // Multiplies 7 and 4
System.out.println("Product: " + product); // Output: Product: 28
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Division (/)</span>

```java
double quotient = 25.0 / 5.0; // Divides 25.0 by 5.0 (note use of doubles to avoid integer division)
System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient); // Output: Quotient: 5.0
int intQuotient = 25 / 5; // Integer division: result is also an integer
System.out.println("Integer Quotient: " + intQuotient); //Output: Integer Quotient: 5
int intQuotient2 = 26 / 5; // Integer division: result is also an integer - truncated
System.out.println("Integer Quotient: " + intQuotient2); //Output: Integer Quotient: 5

```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Modulus (%)</span>

```java
int remainder = 17 % 5; // Finds the remainder when 17 is divided by 5
System.out.println("Remainder: " + remainder); // Output: Remainder: 2
```


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Important Note on Integer Division</span>

*Remember that integer division in Java truncates the decimal part.*  To avoid this, use `double` or `float` data types.

<br>

For more detailed information and advanced operators, refer to:

* [Oracle's Java Tutorials on Operators](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html)


This information should provide a solid foundation in understanding *Java arithmetic operators*.  Practice using them to build your Java programming skills!


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Java Unary Operators ‚ûï‚ûñ</span>

Unary operators in Java work on a single operand.  Let's explore the common ones: increment, decrement, and unary plus/minus. This guide covers  'Java unary operators' and 'increment and decrement in Java'.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Increment and Decrement Operators</span> ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

These operators modify a variable's value by adding or subtracting one.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Increment (++):</span>
* **Pre-increment:** `++x` increments *x* before its value is used in the expression.
* **Post-increment:** `x++` increments *x* after its value is used in the expression.

```java
int x = 5;
int y = ++x; // x becomes 6, y becomes 6
System.out.println(x); // Output: 6
System.out.println(y); // Output: 6

int a = 5;
int b = a++; // a becomes 6, b becomes 5
System.out.println(a); // Output: 6
System.out.println(b); // Output: 5
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Decrement (--):</span>
Similar to increment, but subtracts 1.  Pre-decrement (`--x`) and post-decrement (`x--`) behave analogously.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Unary Plus and Minus Operators</span> ‚ûï‚ûñ

These operators change the sign of a numerical value.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Unary Plus (+):</span>
Has little visible effect, mostly used for clarity.

```java
int z = +10; // z becomes 10
System.out.println(z); // Output: 10
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Unary Minus (-):</span>
Changes the sign of a number.

```java
int w = -10; // w becomes -10
System.out.println(w); // Output: -10

int v = -(-5); // Negates -5 making it 5
System.out.println(v); //Output: 5
```

**Note:**  Unary operators have higher precedence than most other operators.

For more detailed information, refer to: [Oracle's Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html) (link to relevant section on operators).


This guide provides a basic overview.  Explore the linked resources for advanced usage and intricacies of Java unary operators!


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Java Assignment Operators ‚úçÔ∏è</span>

Java provides several operators to assign values to variables.  Understanding these is crucial for any Java programmer. Let's explore!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Simple Assignment (=)</span>

The simplest form assigns a value directly to a variable.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example</span>

```java
int x = 10; // x now holds the value 10
System.out.println(x); // Output: 10
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Compound Assignment Operators ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó</span>

These combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment.  They make your code more concise and readable.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Examples</span>

* **`+=` (Addition Assignment):** `x += 5;` is equivalent to `x = x + 5;`
* **`-=` (Subtraction Assignment):** `x -= 3;` is equivalent to `x = x - 3;`
* **`*=` (Multiplication Assignment):** `x *= 2;` is equivalent to `x = x * 2;`
* **`/=` (Division Assignment):** `x /= 4;` is equivalent to `x = x / 4;`
* **`%=` (Modulo Assignment):** `x %= 3;` is equivalent to `x = x % 3;`


```java
int y = 5;
y += 2; // y = 7
System.out.println(y); // Output: 7

y *= 3; // y = 21
System.out.println(y); //Output: 21
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Why Use Compound Assignment?</span>

* **Readability:**  They make code easier to understand.
* **Efficiency:**  Sometimes, the compiler can optimize compound assignments for better performance.

**Note:**  These operators work with other data types like `float`, `double`, etc., as well.

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Java Logical Operators ü§ù</span>

Java provides logical operators to combine or modify boolean expressions within conditional statements.  These are crucial for creating complex decision-making logic in your programs. Let's explore the key players: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT).

## <span style="color:#2980b9">AND (&&) Operator ‚ûï</span>

The `&&` operator returns `true` only if *both* operands are `true`.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example:</span>

```java
boolean x = true;
boolean y = false;
boolean result = x && y; // result will be false
System.out.println(result); // Output: false
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">OR (||) Operator ‚ûï</span>

The `||` operator returns `true` if *at least one* operand is `true`.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example:</span>

```java
boolean x = true;
boolean y = false;
boolean result = x || y; // result will be true
System.out.println(result); // Output: true
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">NOT (!) Operator ‚õî</span>

The `!` operator inverts the boolean value of its operand.  `!true` becomes `false`, and `!false` becomes `true`.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example:</span>

```java
boolean x = true;
boolean result = !x; // result will be false
System.out.println(result); // Output: false
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Conditional Statements with Logical Operators üö¶</span>

Logical operators are frequently used within `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to create more sophisticated conditions.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example:</span>

```java
int age = 20;
boolean hasLicense = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
    System.out.println("You can drive!"); // Output: You can drive!
} else {
    System.out.println("You cannot drive.");
}
```


**Key takeaway:** Mastering *Java logical operators* and their use in *conditional operators in Java* is essential for writing robust and flexible Java programs.

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Java Ternary Operator: A Concise Guide</span> 
üöÄ

The Java ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, provides a concise way to express simple `if-else` statements in a single line of code.  It's a powerful tool for making your code more compact and readable, especially when dealing with simple conditional logic.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Syntax and Structure</span> 

The ternary operator's syntax is as follows:

```java
booleanCondition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse; 
```

It evaluates a `booleanCondition`. If true, it returns `valueIfTrue`; otherwise, it returns `valueIfFalse`.


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example 1: Finding the Maximum</span>

Let's find the maximum of two numbers:

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // max will be 10
System.out.println(max); // Output: 10
```

This single line replaces a longer `if-else` block:

```java
int max;
if (a > b) {
    max = a;
} else {
    max = b;
}
```


### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Example 2: Assigning Grades</span>

Let's assign a grade based on a score:


```java
int score = 85;
String grade = (score >= 90) ? "A" : (score >= 80) ? "B" : "C"; // grade will be "B"
System.out.println(grade); //Output: B
```

This elegantly handles multiple conditions in a compact form.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Ternary Operator vs. If-Else</span>


| Feature          | Ternary Operator                               | If-Else Statement                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**       | Concise, single-line                           | More verbose, multi-line                       |
| **Readability**  | Can be less readable for complex conditions    | Generally more readable for complex conditions |
| **Use Cases**    | Simple conditional assignments                 | Complex logic, multiple conditions             |


**Note:**  While concise, overuse of the ternary operator can reduce code readability if conditions become too complex.  It's best suited for straightforward conditional assignments.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the `Java ternary operator` and its applications, offering clear `ternary operator example in Java` and highlighting its advantages and limitations. Remember to use it judiciously to maintain code clarity. 


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Java Bitwise Operators ‚öôÔ∏è</span>

Bit manipulation in Java involves directly working with the individual bits (0s and 1s) of integer data types.  This is done using *bitwise operators*.  They're powerful for tasks like setting flags, optimizing code, and working with low-level hardware.


## <span style="color:#2980b9">Core Bitwise Operators</span>

Let's explore the key players:

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">AND (&)</span>

Performs a logical AND on each bit.  `1 & 1 = 1`, otherwise `0`.

```java
int a = 5; // 0101 in binary
int b = 3; // 0011 in binary
int result = a & b; // 0001 (1 in decimal)
System.out.println(result); // Output: 1
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">OR (|) </span>

Performs a logical OR on each bit. `0 | 0 = 0`, otherwise `1`.

```java
int a = 5; // 0101
int b = 3; // 0011
int result = a | b; // 0111 (7 in decimal)
System.out.println(result); // Output: 7
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">XOR (^)</span>

Performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR).  `1 ^ 1 = 0`, `0 ^ 0 = 0`, otherwise `1`.

```java
int a = 5; // 0101
int b = 3; // 0011
int result = a ^ b; // 0110 (6 in decimal)
System.out.println(result); // Output: 6
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">NOT (~)</span>

Inverts all bits.  `~0 = -1`, `~1 = -2`, etc.  (Two's complement representation).

```java
int a = 5; // 0101
int result = ~a; // Inverts bits, then applies two's complement.
System.out.println(result); //Output: -6
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Applications of Java Bitwise Operators ‚ú®</span>

* **Setting/Clearing Flags:** Efficiently manage multiple boolean states within a single integer.
* **Cryptography:** Used in various encryption and hashing algorithms.
* **Low-level Programming:** Interacting with hardware devices and memory addresses.
* **Image Processing:** Manipulating pixel data.
* **Game Development:** Optimizing game logic and rendering.
