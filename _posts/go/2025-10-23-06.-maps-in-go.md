# <span style="color:#e67e22">Maps in Go 🗺️</span>

Go maps are like dictionaries or hash tables in other languages. They store data in **key-value** pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to a specific value. Think of it as a phone book, where names (keys) map to phone numbers (values).

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Declaring and Initializing Maps 🛠️</span>

You can create a map using `make(map[K]V)` or with a *map literal*:

```go
// Using make
myMap := make(map[string]int) // Key: string, Value: int

// Using a map literal
anotherMap := map[string]string{"name": "Alice", "city": "Wonderland"}
```
**Key and Value Types**:
 *   Keys (K) must be comparable types (e.g., `string`, `int`, `bool`).
 *   Values (V) can be any type.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Using Maps 🚀</span>

Here’s how to use a map:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a map
    studentGrades := make(map[string]int)

    // Add key-value pairs
    studentGrades["Alice"] = 90
    studentGrades["Bob"] = 80
    studentGrades["Charlie"] = 70

    // Access a value
    fmt.Println("Alice's grade:", studentGrades["Alice"]) // Output: Alice's grade: 90

    // Check if a key exists
    grade, ok := studentGrades["David"] // ok is true if "David" exists
    if ok {
        fmt.Println("David's grade:", grade)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("David's grade not found") // Output: David's grade not found
    }
     // Delete a key-value pair
    delete(studentGrades, "Bob")
}
```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Working with Key-Value Pairs 🔑</span>

Let's learn how to manage data using *key-value pairs*, kind of like a digital dictionary!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Adding New Entries ➕</span>

To add a new entry, imagine giving it a unique `key` and then assigning a `value` to it. For example:

```python
my_dict = {} # start with an empty dictionary
my_dict["name"] = "Alice" # key: "name", value: "Alice" (string)
my_dict["age"] = 30 # key: "age", value: 30 (integer)
my_dict["is_student"] = False # key: "is_student", value: False (boolean)
print(my_dict) # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'is_student': False}
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Retrieving Values 🔎</span>

To get a value, just ask for it by its `key`:

```python
name = my_dict["name"]
print(name) # Output: Alice
```
*Remember:* Keys must be unique.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Updating Values 🔄</span>

Want to change a value? Simply assign a new value to the existing key:

```python
my_dict["age"] = 31
print(my_dict["age"]) # Output: 31
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Deleting Entries 🗑️</span>

Use `del` to remove a key-value pair:

```python
del my_dict["is_student"]
print(my_dict) # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31}
```

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Keys are unique identifiers.
    *   Values can be any data type (string, number, boolean, etc.)
    *   `del` removes the entire key-value pair.

# <span style="color:#e67e22">The Comma-Ok Idiom in Go: Checking Map Keys</span> 🔑

Go's `map` data structure doesn't throw an error when you try to access a key that doesn't exist. Instead, it returns the zero value for the map's value type. This can be confusing, so Go provides a neat trick called the "comma-ok idiom" to check if a key is actually present.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">How it Works</span> 🤔

The syntax looks like this: `value, ok := myMap[key]`.

*   `value`: This will hold the value associated with the key, or the zero value if the key is missing.
*   `ok`: This is a boolean variable. It will be `true` if the key exists in the map, and `false` if it doesn't.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Missing Key vs. Zero Value</span> 🧐

It's important to understand the difference:

*   **Missing Key:** The key literally *isn't* in the map. `ok` will be `false`.
*   **Zero Value:** The key *is* in the map, but its associated value is the zero value for that type (e.g., `0` for `int`, `""` for `string`, `false` for `bool`). `ok` will be `true`.

```go
myMap := map[string]int{"age": 30, "count": 0}

age, ok := myMap["age"] // age = 30, ok = true
city, ok := myMap["city"] // city = 0, ok = false (key doesn't exist)
count, ok := myMap["count"] // count = 0, ok = true (key exists, value is 0)

fmt.Println(age, ok)
fmt.Println(city, ok)
fmt.Println(count,ok)
```

This example shows that `city` returns the *zero value* for an int, but `ok` is false when it doesn't exists, also `count` which is initialized to `0` has the `ok` set to true.

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Iterating Through Maps in Go with `range` 🗺️</span>

Go's `range` keyword makes looping through maps super easy! The important thing to remember is that the **iteration order is not guaranteed**. It can be random each time you run your program. Let's explore how it works.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Key-Only Iteration 🔑</span>

You can get only the keys of the map using `for key := range myMap`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    myMap := map[string]int{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

    fmt.Println("Iterating over keys:")
    for key := range myMap {
        fmt.Println("Key:", key)
    }
}
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Key-Value Iteration 🔑➡️Value</span>

To access both keys and values, use `for key, value := range myMap`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    myMap := map[string]int{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

    fmt.Println("Iterating over keys and values:")
    for key, value := range myMap {
        fmt.Printf("Key: %s, Value: %d\n", key, value)
    }
}
```

*   **`range` provides a simple way to iterate.**
*   *Remember, the order isn't predictable!*
*   Use `key := range map` for keys only.
*   Use `key, value := range map` for both keys and values.

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Understanding Go Maps and Nil Values 🗺️</span>

Let's explore maps in Go and how they handle *nil* values! Maps are like dictionaries, storing key-value pairs.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Nil Maps vs. Empty Maps 🧐</span>

A *nil* map is a map that hasn't been initialized. Think of it as a map variable that's declared, but no memory has been allocated. An empty map, on the other hand, is a map that *has* been initialized using `make()`, but it currently contains no key-value pairs.

```go
var nilMap map[string]int  // nil map
emptyMap := make(map[string]int) // empty map
```
Here's a basic **flowchart** to help visualise the difference.
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Map Variable] --> B{Initialized?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Empty Map (make())];
    B -- No --> D[Nil Map];
```

## <span style="color:#8e44ad">Working with Nil Maps - What's Allowed (and Not!) ⛔️</span>

You *can* read from a `nil` map without causing a panic. If you try to access a key in a `nil` map, you'll simply get the *zero value* of the map's value type. However, you *cannot* write (add or update elements) to a `nil` map! Doing so will cause a *panic*.

*   **Reading from a `nil` map:** OK 👍. Returns the zero value of the value type.
*   **Writing to a `nil` map:** PANIC 💥! You must initialize the map with `make()` first.

Example:

```go
var myMap map[string]string

name := myMap["name"] //This works fine, name will be an empty string
//myMap["city"] = "London" //This will cause a panic.

myMap = make(map[string]string)
myMap["city"] = "London" //This is perfectly fine!
```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Maps in Go: Reference Types 🗺️</span>

Go maps are **reference types**. This means a map variable doesn't directly store the data. Instead, it holds a *pointer* to the underlying data structure where key-value pairs are stored. This has important implications when you pass maps to functions.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Passing Maps to Functions ➡️</span>

Because maps are reference types, when you pass a map to a function, you're passing a *copy* of the pointer, not the map's data itself. Therefore, if the function modifies the map (adds, deletes, or updates elements), those changes will be visible to the caller!

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func modifyMap(m map[string]int) {
  m["age"] = 30 // Modifying the map
}

func main() {
  myMap := map[string]int{"name": 25}
  fmt.Println("Before:", myMap) // Output: Before: map[name:25]

  modifyMap(myMap)
  fmt.Println("After:", myMap)  // Output: After: map[age:30 name:25]
}
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Reference Types vs. Value Types 🆚</span>

This is different from **value types** (like `int`, `string`, `struct`). When you pass a value type to a function, you're passing a *copy* of the value. Modifications to the copy *don't* affect the original.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func modifyInt(x int) {
  x = 10 // Modifying the copy of the integer
}

func main() {
  myInt := 5
  fmt.Println("Before:", myInt) // Output: Before: 5

  modifyInt(myInt)
  fmt.Println("After:", myInt)  // Output: After: 5
}
```

Value types create complete copies, and changes to the copy do not impact the original. Reference types share the same underlying data structure.

**Key Takeaway:** Changes to a map passed to a function *will* affect the original map in the calling function because maps are passed by reference.
