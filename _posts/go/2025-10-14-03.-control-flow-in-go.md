# <span style="color:#e67e22">Conditional Statements in Go 🚀</span>

Let's dive into how Go handles conditional logic! Go uses `if`, `if-else`, and `if-else-if` statements to control the flow of your program based on conditions. The best part? No parentheses needed around your conditions, but braces `{}` are *mandatory*.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">`if` Statement 🤔</span>

The `if` statement executes a block of code *only* if a condition is `true`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    age := 25

    if age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You are eligible to vote!")
    }
}
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">`if-else` Statement ⚖️</span>

The `if-else` statement executes one block of code if the condition is `true` and another block if it's `false`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    number := 7

    if number%2 == 0 {
        fmt.Println("Even number")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Odd number")
    }
}
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">`if-else-if` Statement 🪜</span>

The `if-else-if` statement lets you check multiple conditions in sequence.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    score := 75

    if score >= 90 {
        fmt.Println("Excellent!")
    } else if score >= 70 {
        fmt.Println("Good!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Needs improvement")
    }
}
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Short Statement Syntax 💫</span>

Go provides a neat feature within `if` statements: the _short statement_. This allows you to declare and initialize a variable *within* the `if` condition itself.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    if x := getValue(); x > 0 {
        fmt.Println("Value is positive:", x)
    } else {
		fmt.Println("Value is not positive:", x)
	}
}

func getValue() int {
	return -5 // You can change this to test different values.
}
```

In this example, `x := getValue()` is executed *before* the condition `x > 0` is evaluated. The variable `x` is only scoped to the `if` and `else` blocks.

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Go *requires* braces `{}`.
    *   Go *doesn't need* parentheses around conditions `()`.
    *   The short statement syntax (`if x := ...; condition`) is handy!

<!-- Flowchart for if-else-if -->
```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B{Condition 1?};
    B -- True --> C[Execute Block 1];
    B -- False --> D{Condition 2?};
    D -- True --> E[Execute Block 2];
    D -- False --> F[Execute Block 3];
    C --> G[End];
    E --> G;
    F --> G;
```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Switch Statements in Go: A Simple Guide 🚦</span>

Go's `switch` statement is a clean way to handle multiple conditions. Think of it as a more powerful `if-else if-else` chain. The cool part? Go handles `break` for you!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Types of Switches ✨</span>

Go provides different flavors of `switch` statements:

*   **Expression Switch:** Evaluates an expression and matches its value against `case` values.

```go
grade := "B"
switch grade {
case "A":
    println("Excellent!")
case "B":
    println("Good job!")
default:
    println("Keep trying!")
}
```

*   **Type Switch:** Used to determine the *type* of a variable. Super handy when dealing with `interface{}`.

```go
var i interface{} = 10
switch v := i.(type) {
case int:
    println("It's an integer:", v)
case string:
    println("It's a string:", v)
default:
    println("I don't know what it is!")
}
```

## <span style="color:#8e44ad">`fallthrough` Keyword 🍂</span>

Normally, Go executes only the matching `case` and then *automatically* exits the `switch`. The `fallthrough` keyword makes execution *continue* to the next `case`, regardless of whether it matches.

```go
num := 2
switch num {
case 1:
    println("One")
case 2:
    println("Two")
    fallthrough
case 3:
    println("Three")
default:
    println("Something else")
}
// Output:
// Two
// Three
```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Implicit `break` Behavior 👍</span>

Go *implicitly* adds a `break` statement after each `case`. You *don't* need to write `break` yourself. This helps prevent accidental fall-through bugs common in other languages.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Switch with no Expression 🔍</span>

You can also write `switch` statements without an expression. This is similar to using a chain of `if/else if` statements.

```go
age := 25
switch {
case age < 18:
    println("Minor")
case age >= 18 && age < 65:
    println("Adult")
default:
    println("Senior")
}
```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Go's Looping Powerhouse: The `for` Loop 🔄</span>

Go keeps things simple! Instead of multiple loop types like `while` or `do-while` in other languages, Go rocks just *one*: the `for` loop. But don't let that fool you; it's super flexible and can handle all your looping needs.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Three Flavors of `for` 🍦</span>

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Traditional Three-Component `for` ⚙️</span>

Like in C or Java, you've got initialization, condition, and post-statement, all in one line.

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    println(i) // Prints 0 to 4
}
```

*   **Use Case:** Looping a specific number of times, like processing elements in a slice or array.
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start] --> B{i := 0};
    B --> C{i < 5};
    C -- True --> D{println(i)};
    D --> E{i++};
    E --> C;
    C -- False --> F[End];
```
### <span style="color:#8e44ad">While-Style `for` ⏳</span>

Just a condition, like a `while` loop.

```go
i := 0
for i < 5 {
    println(i)
    i++
}
```

*   **Use Case:** Looping until a condition is met, perhaps reading from a stream or waiting for an event.

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">Infinite Loop ♾️</span>

No condition at all!  Keep going until you `break` out.

```go
for {
    // Do something
    if someCondition {
        break // Exit the loop
    }
}
```

*   **Use Case:** Servers listening for incoming connections, or background processes running continuously.

You can find more information about Go `for` loops in the [official Go documentation](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/1).


# <span style="color:#e67e22">The Magic of `range` in Go 🪄</span>

The `range` keyword in Go is your friendly iterator! It makes looping through data structures *easy peasy*. Think of it as a helper that automatically gives you both the index and the value of each item.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">`range` across Different Data Structures 🧰</span>

Let's explore how `range` works with various data types:

*   **Arrays and Slices:**
    ```go
    numbers := []int{10, 20, 30}
    for index, value := range numbers {
        fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", index, value)
    }
    ```
    Here, `index` represents the position (0, 1, 2) and `value` is the element at that position.
*   **Maps:**

    ```go
    ages := map[string]int{"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25}
    for name, age := range ages {
        fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", name, age)
    }
    ```
    `name` becomes the key, and `age` is the value associated with that key.
*   **Strings:**

    ```go
    word := "Hello"
    for index, runeValue := range word {
        fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Rune: %c\n", index, runeValue)
    }
    ```

    *Important Note:* `range` on strings iterates over *runes*, which are Unicode code points (like characters).

*   **Channels:**

    ```go
    ch := make(chan int, 3)
    ch <- 1
    ch <- 2
    close(ch) // important for channels

    for value := range ch {
        fmt.Println("Received:", value)
    }
    ```
    `range` receives values from the channel until it's closed.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Ignoring Values with `_` 🤫</span>

Sometimes, you only need the index (or the key) and not the value. Use the `_` (underscore) to ignore the value:

```go
for index, _ := range numbers { // ignores the value
    fmt.Println("Index:", index)
}
```

`range` simplifies looping, providing a clean and efficient way to iterate through Go's core data structures!


# <span style="color:#e67e22">Loop Control: Break & Continue</span> 🚀

Let's explore how to fine-tune your loops with `break` and `continue`!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Breaking Free & Skipping Ahead</span>

*   **`break`:** Think of `break` as an emergency exit. It immediately *terminates* the loop's execution, even if the loop condition is still true.

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        if i == 3:
            break  # Exit the loop when i is 3
        print(i) # output: 0, 1, 2
    ```

*   **`continue`:** `continue` is like a "fast forward" button. It *skips* the current iteration and jumps to the next one.

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        if i == 2:
            continue  # Skip iteration when i is 2
        print(i) # output: 0, 1, 3, 4
    ```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Labeled Break & Continue</span>

*   For nested loops, you can use labels with `break` and `continue` to specify which loop you want to affect.

    ```python
    outer_loop: for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if i == 1 and j == 1:
                break outer_loop  # Exit the outer loop
            print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
    ```

Here is a flow chart explaining `break` and `continue` statement.
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Loop] --> B{Condition};
    B -- True --> C{Code};
    C --> D{Break Statement?};
    D -- Yes --> E[Exit Loop];
    D -- No --> F{Continue Statement?};
    F -- Yes --> B;
    F -- No --> G[Execute Rest of Loop];
    G --> B;
    B -- False --> E;
    E --> H[End];
```

**Practical Example:** Searching in a 2D grid. If we find the target, we want to stop the entire search.

# <span style="color:#e67e22">`goto` Statements and Labels in Go</span> 🚀

`goto` in Go jumps execution to a labeled point within a function. Labels are markers in your code, like `errHandler:` before a block.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">When `goto` Can Be Helpful</span>

*   **Error Handling:** Quickly jump to a central error handling block.

    ```go
    func myFunc() error {
        // ... some code
        if err != nil {
            goto errHandler // Jump to error handling
        }
        // ... more code
    errHandler:
        return fmt.Errorf("error occurred: %w", err)
    }
    ```

*   **Breaking Nested Loops:** Exit multiple nested loops efficiently.

    ```go
    loop:
        for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
            for j := 0; j < 3; j++ {
                if i*j > 5 {
                    goto loop // Exit both loops
                }
            }
        }
    ```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Why Use Sparingly?</span>

`goto` can make code harder to read and understand. Too many `goto` statements can create what is commonly referred to as "spaghetti code". This makes debugging and maintaining the code much more difficult.

*   It complicates control flow.
*   It reduces code readability.

**Best Practice:** Prefer structured control flow (if/else, loops, functions). Use `goto` only when necessary and with extreme caution.

For more info you can check the official documentation on [Go's control flow](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/1).
