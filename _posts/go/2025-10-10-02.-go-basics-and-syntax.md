# <span style="color:#e67e22">Go Program Structure 🚀</span>

Let's break down the basic structure of a Go program. Think of it like building with Lego bricks!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Core Components 🧱</span>

Every Go program has three main ingredients:

*   **Package Declaration:** The first line *always* declares the `package`. This tells Go which "group" the code belongs to.

    *   Example: `package main`
*   **Import Statements:** These are like bringing in tools or libraries from other packages. `import` statements bring in other packages.

    *   Example: `import "fmt"`
*   **The `main` Function:** This is where the magic happens! Go starts running your code from the `main` function. It *must* be in a `package main`.

    *   Example: `func main() { ... }`

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Packages: Organizing Your Code 🗂️</span>

Packages are how Go organizes code. They're like folders on your computer.

*   `package main` is special. It creates an executable program. Think of it as the "start button" for your program.
*   Other packages are libraries of reusable code.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Example Code Snippet 📝</span>

```go
 package main  // Declares the package as 'main' - the entry point

 import "fmt"   // Imports the 'fmt' package for printing

 func main() {  // The main function - where execution begins
  fmt.Println("Hello, Go!") // Prints "Hello, Go!" to the console
 }
 ```

In the above code,
1. `package main` indicates that this code is the main program.
2.  `import "fmt"` imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatted I/O (input/output), such as printing to the console.
3.  `func main() { ... }` defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program. When you run the program, the code inside this function is executed.
4. `fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")` is the core of the program. It uses the `Println` function from the `fmt` package to print the string "Hello, Go!" to the console. This is a common way to display output in Go programs.

Go programs can be structured in several ways, here is an example of basic program flow:

```mermaid
 flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{package main};
    B --> C{import packages};
    C --> D{func main()};
    D --> E[Execute code];
    E --> F[End];
```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Variable & Constant Declarations in Go 🚀</span>

Go offers a couple of ways to declare variables and define constants, let's explore them!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Variable Declarations 🤔</span>

We have two main styles:

*   **`var` keyword:** You explicitly declare the variable's *name* and *type*.
    ```go
    var age int  // Declare an integer variable named 'age'
    age = 30       // Assign a value to 'age'
    var name string = "Alice" // Declare and initialize in one line
    ```

*   **Shorthand `:=` operator:** Go infers the variable's type based on the assigned value. You can use this _only_ inside a function.
    ```go
    quantity := 10    // Go infers that 'quantity' is an integer
    message := "Hello" // Go infers that 'message' is a string
    ```

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Value Assigned] --> B{Type Inference?};
        B -- Yes --> C[Variable declared with inferred type];
        B -- No --> D[Explicit Type Declaration needed];
    ```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Constants 🌟</span>

Constants use the `const` keyword. Their value must be known at compile time and cannot be changed later. Go also supports type inference for constants.

```go
const pi = 3.14159 // Go infers the type (float64)
const maxRetries int = 3 // Explicit type declaration

// multiple constants with the same type can be declared in one statement
const (
	E   = 2.71828
	PI  = 3.1416
)
```

### <span style="color:#8e44ad">When to Use Each Style 🎯</span>

*   Use `var` when you want to declare a variable without immediately assigning a value, or when you want to be explicit about the type.
*   Use `:=` for concise declaration and initialization inside functions, letting Go infer the type.
*   Use `const` for values that are known at compile time and will not change, like mathematical constants or configuration values.

    ```go
    // Example with different data types
    var isLoggedIn bool = true
    temperature := 25.5 // float64
    const greeting = "Welcome!"
    ```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Go's Data Types: A Quick Guide</span> 🚀

Go has several built-in data types for storing different kinds of information. Let's explore them!

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Numbers: Integers & Floats</span> 🔢

*   **Integers:** Whole numbers! Go offers `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, and their `uint` (unsigned) versions.  `int`'s size depends on your system (32 or 64 bits). `int8` stores numbers from -128 to 127 (8 bits), `int16` does -32768 to 32767 (16 bits), etc.

    ```go
    var age int = 30 // Example
    var smallNumber int8 = 10
    ```

*   **Floats:** Numbers with decimal points. We have `float32` (32-bit) and `float64` (64-bit, more precise).

    ```go
    var price float64 = 99.99 // Example
    ```

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Other Basics</span> 🧱

*   **Boolean:** `bool` represents `true` or `false`.

    ```go
    var isReady bool = true // Example
    ```

*   **String:** Sequence of characters. Immutable.

    ```go
    var name string = "GoLang" // Example
    ```

*   **Rune:** Represents a Unicode code point (character). Usually an alias for `int32`.

    ```go
    var letter rune = 'A' // Example
    ```

*   **Complex Numbers:** `complex64` and `complex128` represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.

    ```go
    var complexNumber complex128 = complex(1, 2) // Example
    ```

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Type Conversion & Zero Values in Go 🚀</span>

Go is strict about types. Sometimes, you need to change a variable's type explicitly. This is called **explicit type conversion**.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Explicit Conversion</span>

You do this using the `Type(variable)` syntax.

```go
var myInt int = 42
var myFloat float64 = float64(myInt) // Convert int to float64
println(myFloat)
```

**Important:** You *can't* convert between unrelated types (like `int` to `string`) directly.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Zero Values 😴</span>

When you declare a variable without initializing it, Go gives it a **zero value** based on its type:

*   Numbers (`int`, `float64`): `0`
*   `bool`: `false`
*   `string`: `""` (empty string)
*   Pointers: `nil`

```go
var myInt int
var myBool bool
var myString string
var myPointer *int

println(myInt)   // Output: 0
println(myBool)  // Output: false
println(myString) // Output: ""
println(myPointer == nil) // Output: true
```
Understanding these concepts makes your Go code more predictable! ✨

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Operators in Programming 🚀</span>

Here's a friendly guide to some common operators you'll find in programming:

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Arithmetic Operators ➕➖✖️➗</span>

These are your everyday math tools!

*   `+` (Addition): Adds two numbers.  Example: `5 + 3` equals `8`.
*   `-` (Subtraction): Subtracts one number from another. Example: `10 - 4` equals `6`.
*   `*` (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers. Example: `2 * 6` equals `12`.
*   `/` (Division): Divides one number by another. Example: `15 / 3` equals `5`.
*   `%` (Modulo):  Returns the remainder of a division. Example: `16 % 5` equals `1`.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Comparison Operators ⚖️</span>

These operators help you compare values, returning `true` or `false`.

*   `==` (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal. Example: `5 == 5` is `true`.
*   `!=` (Not equal to): Checks if two values are *not* equal. Example: `5 != 6` is `true`.
*   `<` (Less than): Checks if one value is less than another. Example: `3 < 7` is `true`.
*   `>` (Greater than): Checks if one value is greater than another. Example: `8 > 2` is `true`.
*   `<=` (Less than or equal to): Checks if one value is less than or equal to another. Example: `4 <= 4` is `true`.
*   `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another. Example: `9 >= 5` is `true`.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Logical Operators 🧠</span>

These combine or modify boolean expressions (`true` or `false`).

*   `&&` (AND): Returns `true` if *both* conditions are `true`. Example: `(5 > 3) && (2 < 4)` is `true`.
*   `||` (OR): Returns `true` if *at least one* condition is `true`. Example: `(5 > 3) || (2 > 4)` is `true`.
*   `!` (NOT): Reverses the boolean value. Example: `!(5 > 3)` is `false`.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Bitwise Operators 🎛️</span>

These work directly on the binary representation of numbers.

*   `&` (AND): Performs a bitwise AND. Example: `5 & 3` (0101 & 0011) equals `1` (0001).
*   `|` (OR): Performs a bitwise OR. Example: `5 | 3` (0101 | 0011) equals `7` (0111).
*   `^` (XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR). Example: `5 ^ 3` (0101 ^ 0011) equals `6` (0110).
*   `<<` (Left shift): Shifts bits to the left. Example: `5 << 1` (0101 << 1) equals `10` (1010).
*   `>>` (Right shift): Shifts bits to the right. Example: `5 >> 1` (0101 >> 1) equals `2` (0010).

# <span style="color:#e67e22">Commenting in Go & Code Formatting</span> 📝

Go uses comments to explain your code. Let's break down the types:

*   `//` : _Single-line comments_. Use these for quick explanations.
*   `/* */` : _Multi-line comments_. Great for longer explanations spanning multiple lines.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Documentation with Godoc</span> 📚

Use special comments for documentation:

```go
// MyFunction does something useful.
func MyFunction() {
  //...your code here
}
```

Godoc generates documentation from these.

## <span style="color:#2980b9">Automatic Formatting</span> ⚙️

`gofmt` and `goimports` are *crucial*. They automatically format your code, ensuring consistency across projects and readability.

**Why it matters:** Clean, consistent code is easier to read, understand, and maintain. Run `gofmt` and `goimports` regularly (most IDEs support this).

**Best Practices:**
*   Write clear, concise comments.
*   Use Godoc for public functions/types.
*   **Always** use `gofmt` and `goimports`.
*   Aim for readability above all else.
*   Resources on Golang comments [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#commentary) and [Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc/comment).
